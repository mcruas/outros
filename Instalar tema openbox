This is what I usually do, for my (#!) Openbox . . . I go to http://box-look.com

Go the the Openbox Themes section, find what looks nice, download the 'tar' file. (save to my Downloads folder)

Click on the 'tar' and extract the file ... then, go to ~/usr/share/themes (Open as Admin/Root) and copy the extracted 'tar' folder to Themes.

Close everything and in the Menu  >  Settings>Openbox>Reconfigure

Done ... open Settings>Openbox>GUI Config Tool and 'open' the new theme.
